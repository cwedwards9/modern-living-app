Modern Living is the centralized place for all things needed for home improvement. Users can create an account for access to all of Modern Living's resources. Modern Living provides all of the important parts of starting and completing a project from finding a specific contractor in your area to keeping track of the status of your project. Users can find important information on handymen in their city and can save them to their profile if they are interested in them or to refer back to them for future projects. Users can also search and save design ideas to give them inspiration for their own projects.      
      
Modern Living allows users to create projects and make notes along the way as they continue to work on their projects. Notes about how the project is going, what materials the user needs, and how a certain contractor worked out for them to name a few.     
      
Unsure about some of the tools and materials you may need for your next project? We have some starter guides to help you start your next project. Simply look in the category your project falls under and find your tools.
